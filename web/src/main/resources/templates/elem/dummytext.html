                <p>I am ready for the road less traveled. Already <a href="#">brushing off the dust</a>. Yeah, you're
                    lucky if you're on her plane. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. Uh, She’s a beast. I call
                    her Karma (come back). Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band. I can't sleep let's run away
                    and don't ever look back, don't ever look back.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Growing fast into a <strong>bolt of lightning</strong>. Be careful Try not to lead her on</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating. Oh oh! Wanna be a victim ready for abduction.
                    She's got that international smile, oh yeah, she's got that one international smile. Do you ever
                    feel, feel so paper thin. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt your
                    popsicle.</p>
                <p>This is transcendental, on another level, boy, you're my lucky star.</p>

                <p>From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Yeah, you take me to utopia. I'm walking on air. We'd make out in your
                    Mustang to Radiohead. I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Sun-kissed skin so hot we'll melt
                    your popsicle. Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I hope you got a healthy appetite.</li>
                    <li>You're never gonna be unsatisfied.</li>
                    <li>Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Don't need apologies. Boy, you're an alien your touch so foreign, it's <em>supernatural</em>,
                    extraterrestrial. Talk about our future like we had a clue. I can feel a phoenix inside of me.</p>
